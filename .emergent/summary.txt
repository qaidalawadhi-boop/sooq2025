The AI engineer successfully initiated development of a full-stack e-commerce application, initially named Bazari, later renamed Souq Express. The development progressed through several phases: a frontend-only mock-up, full backend integration, implementation of a comprehensive admin dashboard with authentication, and a password change feature. Despite numerous successful API tests and AI self-declarations of completeness, the frontend consistently encountered issues, primarily a Mixed Content Error (HTTPS page calling HTTP API) and a general failure to load the site visually. The AI engineer attempted multiple fixes, including forcing HTTPS for API calls and temporarily reverting to mock data. The final state of the product, as reported by the user, is that the main Souq Express platform is still not working, indicating persistent frontend issues. The AI engineer then pivoted to developing an accounting system, which was interrupted by the user's latest bug report regarding the Souq Express platform's non-functionality.

<product_requirements>
The primary requirement was to develop a full-stack e-commerce platform similar to Bazari, initially focusing on replicating its UI/UX. Key features requested included a robust product display, advanced search/filter, shopping cart, seller pages, and a review system, all with Arabic (RTL) language support and a modern design. After the initial build, the user requested a comprehensive admin dashboard for managing products, categories, sellers, orders, and system settings, followed by a secure password change feature for admins. The brand name was then changed from Bazari to Souq Express across the entire application. Most recently, the user requested the development of a new, integrated accounting system similar to Yemen Soft. The current problem is a critical bug where the main Souq Express platform is reportedly not working.

<key_technical_concepts>
- Frontend: React.js, Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS, Axios, React Router,  custom hook.
- Backend: FastAPI, MongoDB (AsyncIOMotorClient), Pydantic models, JWT authentication, Bcrypt for password hashing.
- Development Workflow: Supervisor for service management,  for API documentation.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.

Detailed Directory Structure:


- ****: The main React application entry point, responsible for defining routes (for both public and admin sections) and integrating various components. It uses  and .
- ****: Renders the main e-commerce landing page, initially using mock data, later updated to fetch real data from backend APIs.
- ****: Contains the application's header, including branding (Souq Express logo), search bar, and navigation icons. Updated to dynamically fetch categories.
- ****: Manages API calls for the public-facing frontend. It was crucial for handling the  and later debugging mixed content errors.
- ****: Stores initial mock data for products, categories, sellers, and reviews, used during the frontend-only development phase.
- ****: The main FastAPI application entry point. It includes the API router, middleware for CORS, and integrates all backend routes and models. It also defines basic status check endpoints.
- ****: Defines Pydantic models for core e-commerce entities (Categories, Products, Sellers, Reviews), used for data validation and serialization/deserialization with MongoDB.
- ****: Defines Pydantic models specifically for admin functionalities, including , , and dashboard statistics.
- ****: Defines Pydantic models for the new accounting system, including Chart of Accounts, Journals, and Ledgers.
- ****: Handles the MongoDB connection using  and includes helper functions for database initialization.
- ****: Contains API endpoints for different modules (products, categories, sellers, reviews, admin, accounting). These files define CRUD operations and business logic for their respective domains.  was heavily modified for admin authentication, user management, and dashboard data.
- ****: A new directory created for admin panel UI components, including  for authentication,  for the admin panel structure (sidebar, header),  for statistics, and  for the password update feature.
- ****: Manages API calls specifically for the admin panel, handling authentication tokens and admin-specific endpoints.
- ****: A documentation file outlining API contracts and integration details between frontend and backend.
- ****: Used for recording testing results and communication with the testing sub-agent.

<pending_tasks>
- Full functionality for admin sub-modules (Orders, Products, Categories, Sellers, Settings pages declared as قيد التطوير - under development in terms of full functionality).
- Implementing the comprehensive Smart Accountant System (نظام المحاسب الذكي) backend and frontend.
- **Urgent**: Debugging and resolving the current issue where the main Souq Express platform is reported as not working.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with developing a new, integrated accounting system, نظام المحاسب الذكي (Smart Accountant System), similar to Yemen Soft. The AI engineer had started this task by creating new backend database models () and setting up new API routes (), and then updating the main  to include these new accounting routes.

However, this development was interrupted by a critical bug report from the user. The user explicitly stated: منصة سوق اكسبرس لا تعمل الى الان وتظهر انها قيد التطوير (Souq Express platform is still not working and shows it is under development) (Chat Message 316), and reiterated: لقد قمت بتجربة الموقع حاليا لا يعمل (I tried the website now, it's not working) (Chat Message 320).

The AI engineer's immediate action, as per Chat Message 322, is to investigate and fix this bug by checking service status and error logs, implying the current focus has shifted entirely from new feature development to critical bug resolution for the core Souq Express platform.
